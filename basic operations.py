#solving a mathmatical operation

length = 10
width = 20
area = length * width 

print("The area of the rectangle with a length of " + str(length) + " and a width of " + str(width) + " is " + str(area))

#The area of the rectangle with a length of <length> and a width of <width> is <area>.


#The purpose of stringing together numbers is to combine the program to complete a math equation.
#I can see this being useful for programs that are designed for younger poeple to help learn math.
#combinding both the "print" feaure and the "str" you can program complete equations out with one line of code.
